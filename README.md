## 📱 Android App

This project includes a native Android application built with Capacitor!

### Building the Android App

The Verum Omnis application can be built as a native Android app that includes:
- Full AI-powered legal forensics interface
- Integrated Master Forensic Archive PDF (v5.2.7)
- **Company Branding**: Dual logo display with professional styling
- **Watermarked Reports**: Forensic reports with watermark indicators
- **Password Protection**: Optional password-protected report generation
- **Cryptographic Document Sealing**: SHA-256 hash sealing for all uploads/downloads
- **Geolocation Support**: Jurisdiction detection and timestamp accuracy
- **Constitutional Enforcement Layer**: Standing detection, honesty enforcement, and shutdown logic
- **Automated Builds**: GitHub Actions workflow for signed APK releases
- Native Android performance
- Offline capabilities

## 🛡️ Constitutional Enforcement Layer

This application enforces constitutional forensic standards through multiple layers:

### 1. Universal Sealing

All evidence is cryptographically sealed with SHA-256 hashing, ensuring integrity regardless of deployment context.

### 2. Forensic Integrity

Evidence processing is deterministic - same input always produces same output, critical for legal proceedings.

### 3. Optional AI Enhancement

AI features are advisory only and fail gracefully - the forensic engine continues operating without AI availability.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test
```

### Android Build

```bash
# Sync and build Android
npm run android:build

# Open in Android Studio
npm run android:open

# Run on connected device
npm run android:run
```

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ Web application: Built and tested
- ✅ Android support: Configured and ready
- ✅ Cryptographic sealing: Implemented
- ✅ Evidence management: Complete
- ⏳ AI integration: Requires Spark backend configuration

## 🔐 Security Model

### What's Protected
- Evidence integrity (cryptographic sealing)
- Report generation (watermarked PDFs)
- Case management (encrypted storage)
- Forensic certificates (SHA-256 hashing)

### What's Optional
